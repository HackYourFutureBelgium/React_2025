# Homework

### Start the homework

Need to brush up on the homework setup process? Check [this](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/Git_2025/blob/main/homework-submission.md) out before you get into some git confusion!

This week the homework will result in 2 PRs: 1 in your homework repository and 1 in the Meal Sharing repository.

The homework for this week are the class exercises, along with the meal sharing app.

## Meal sharing

Let's not forget to give some attention to the meal sharing frontend!  
You have built a `MealsList` last week.  
Now build the `Meal` component so that you can use it in the `MealsList` and render a nice card for each meal.  
Decide how the meal card should look like and style it.  
The component should accept a meal object as a prop and render all its relevant details.  
The `MealsList` should render all the meals in a grid.
